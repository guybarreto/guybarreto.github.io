    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Professional with over 10 years of market experience. I started to work in the Administrative area starting as an Office Clerk, soon after being promoted to Administrative Assistant and then a Survey Specialist, a position I held until the end of 2016. After that, I continued as a freelance, working with surveys until the beginning of 2020, when I started to work in the Accounting area. However, it wasn't what I was looking for.<br><br>

    So it was in the IT area that I found the inexhaustible fuel I needed to fill my thirst for new knowledge and technologies. It's an inexplicable love/hate relationship, with high doses of excitement and that makes me very happy! Using technology to solve people/world problems is great! That's it, I found out how to make my own mark on the world!<br><br>
        
    I'm currently studying Web Devlopment at Trybe and improving my English skills.</p>
