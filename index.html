    <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
    <p>Brazilian professional with over 10 years of market experience. I started to work in the Administrative area starting as an Office Clerk, soon after being promoted to Administrative Assistant and then a Survey Specialist, a position I held until the end of 2016. After that, I continued as a freelance, working with surveys until the beginning of 2020, when I started to work in the Accounting area. However, it wasn't what I was looking for.<br><br>

    So it was in the <strong>IT</strong> area that I found the inexhaustible fuel I needed to fill my thirst for new knowledge and technologies. It's an inexplicable love relationship, with high doses of excitement and that makes me <em>very happy</em>! Using technology to solve people/world problems is great! That's it, I found out how to make my own mark on the world!<br><br>
        
    I live in Aracaju/SE and I'm currently studying Web Devlopment at <strong>Trybe</strong> and improving my English skills.</p>
